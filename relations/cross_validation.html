     <b>Figure 1.</b> Comparison of features for dog classification. <br>Experiment
     with all training samples (with no preference, filtering or augmentation) using
     the following SPM configuration: 2 levels, basic feature pooling (each 8 pixels).<br>
     Notice that the performance of Color-SIFT is lower than regular SIFT.<hr>

     <b>Figure 2.</b> Comparison of features for dog classification. <br>Experiment
     with all training samples using
     the following SPM configuration: 3 levels, dense feature pooling (each 2 pixels for SIFT
     and each 4 pixels for Color-SIFT).<hr>

     <b>Figure 3.</b> Comparison of features for dog classification. <br>Experiment
     using 3-level SPM + dense feature pooling, using a clean training set, i.e. low-entropy
     negative samples and augmented positives. It is important to note that the number of
     negatives is less here than in the experiment in Figure 2. It may be an easier task as
     well, given the number of positives samples and the easy negatives. However, in the
     validation set, this configuration also performed significantly better.
